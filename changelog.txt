========== v4.2 ==========

    - Audio visualizers!
        *** Some visualizers might not run smoothly on less powerful devices ***
        *** Runs smoothly on Core2 Quad Q9450 (2008) & HD7770 (2012) ***
        - Iverjo is the most intensive of the visualisations
        - Iverjo and Plaid work best with songs that have heavier bass and drums
        - If Iverjo or Plaid aren't reacting very much with a song, it's because Iverjo averages the first 4 bins (see analyser), and plaid uses the second, which works well with some songs and badly with others :/.
